EcoRide – Smarter Commutes, Greener Future

Description:We present an innovative Carpooling Solution designed specifically for organizations to streamline employee transportation. Our app fosters community-based commuting by enabling employees to carpool, helping organizations save costs, reduce their carbon footprint, and promote eco-friendly travel.


Key features:
Security through Secret Code:
Only employees with a unique secret code provided by the company can access the app, ensuring restricted and secure access.

Payment Calculation 
The app calculates the price of carpool rides based on the distance traveled.

Distance Calculation:
Using the GraphHopper API, the app accurately calculates the distance between source and destination points.
This ensures fair pricing and precise travel estimates.

Incentives for Carpoolers:
Drivers (carpoolers) receive a 10% incentive after successfully completing 4 rides, encouraging regular carpooling participation.

Optimized Route Matching:
Matches passengers with drivers based on route proximity, direction, and timing, ensuring convenient and efficient travel.

Eco-Friendly Travel:
Encourages sustainable commuting by reducing vehicle usage, contributing to lower emissions and a greener environment.



Technologies used:
Backend:
Python is used to build the backend logic, including route matching, distance calculations, and incentive tracking.

Frontend:
Flutter provides a cross-platform UI for seamless interaction across Android and iOS.
Employees use the app to enter their details, view routes, and check pricing estimates.

Open-Source API:
GraphHopper API is integrated to calculate distances, routes, and bearings efficiently.

Security:
Employees need a unique secret code from the company to access the app, ensuring restricted access.

Payment Calculation:
The app calculates ride prices based on distance traveled, but no actual payment is processed within the app.

Incentive System:
Drivers offering carpool services receive a 10% incentive after every 4 successful rides to encourage participation.
